# responses-api-compat Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Explicit upstream previous-response denials retire proxy-injected anchors

When upstream answers an HTTP bridge request with a `previous_response_not_found` terminal frame, and the `previous_response_id` on that request was injected by the proxy onto a full-resend-shaped payload, the proxy MUST retire that anchor on the first denial rather than waiting for the eventless-failure poison threshold. Retirement MUST attempt to clear the durable continuity record under the session's owner epoch, and MUST clear the in-memory session anchor.

The proxy MUST NOT retire the anchor when:

- the anchor was supplied by the client, because removing it changes the meaning of the client's own request;
- the anchor was injected onto a payload that is not full-resend shaped, because a delta-only request has no other way to convey prior context once its anchor is gone;
- the session's current anchor is no longer the denied id, because a concurrent request may have completed and advanced it.

When the durable clear cannot be confirmed, the proxy MUST NOT report the anchor as retired, and MUST still clear the in-memory anchor, which strictly removes one carrier that could re-inject the denied id. A durable record that survives re-injects the id on a later turn, which is denied in turn and re-enters this path, so the clear is re-attempted rather than lost.

Retirement is bookkeeping and MUST NOT change how the denial is delivered downstream. A failure while retiring MUST NOT propagate into terminal-event handling.

A denial that settles several requests sharing one anchor MUST retire that anchor once, on the same terms.

The downstream error contract is unchanged: the denial is still reported to the client as `stream_incomplete`, so the client retains its own anchor and is not driven into a full-history resend.

#### Scenario: A denied proxy-injected anchor is retired immediately

- **GIVEN** an HTTP bridge session whose stored anchor was injected by the proxy
- **WHEN** upstream answers the anchored request with `previous_response_not_found`
- **THEN** the proxy clears the durable continuity record under the session's owner epoch
- **AND** clears the in-memory session anchor and its stored input count and prefix fingerprint
- **AND** the next turn on that session dispatches without a `previous_response_id`

#### Scenario: The following turn is not trimmed against a denied anchor

- **GIVEN** a proxy-injected anchor was denied by upstream on the previous turn
- **WHEN** the client sends a full resend of the conversation on the next turn
- **THEN** the request MUST NOT be trimmed against the denied anchor's stored prefix
- **AND** upstream receives the resent conversation rather than a suffix of it

#### Scenario: A concurrent completion protects the current anchor

- **GIVEN** a proxy-injected anchor is denied by upstream
- **AND** another request on the same session completed first and advanced the session anchor to a different response id
- **WHEN** the denial is handled
- **THEN** the proxy MUST NOT clear the session anchor

#### Scenario: Client-supplied anchors are left alone

- **GIVEN** an HTTP bridge request carries a `previous_response_id` the client supplied
- **WHEN** upstream answers it with `previous_response_not_found`
- **THEN** the proxy MUST NOT retire the anchor on the client's behalf

#### Scenario: A delta-only payload keeps its injected anchor

- **GIVEN** the proxy injected an anchor onto a payload that is not full-resend shaped
- **WHEN** upstream answers that request with `previous_response_not_found`
- **THEN** the proxy MUST NOT clear the anchor
- **AND** the request keeps the only reference it has to its prior context

#### Scenario: A fan-out denial retires the shared anchor once

- **GIVEN** several pending requests on one session share a proxy-injected anchor
- **WHEN** upstream answers with a single `previous_response_not_found` that settles all of them together
- **THEN** the proxy retires that anchor before the grouped settlement completes

#### Scenario: An unconfirmed durable clear still drops the in-memory anchor

- **GIVEN** a denied proxy-injected anchor whose durable clear is fenced or fails
- **WHEN** the denial is handled
- **THEN** the proxy MUST clear the in-memory session anchor
- **AND** MUST NOT report the anchor as retired

#### Scenario: A retirement failure cannot change the denial delivered downstream

- **GIVEN** the bookkeeping performed while retiring a denied anchor raises
- **WHEN** the denial is handled
- **THEN** the error MUST NOT propagate into terminal-event handling

### Requirement: Anchored recovery retries retain the provenance of the anchor they replay

When the HTTP bridge dispatches an anchored recovery retry that replays a `previous_response_id` the proxy injected, the retry request state MUST record that the anchor is proxy-injected. A recovery path that dispatches without an anchor MUST leave that provenance false, because there is no anchor for it to describe.

#### Scenario: An anchored recovery retry is attributable to the proxy

- **GIVEN** a request whose `previous_response_id` was injected by the proxy fails and enters anchored recovery
- **WHEN** the recovery retry replays the same anchor
- **THEN** the retry request state records the anchor as proxy-injected
- **AND** continuity diagnostics for the retry report `previous_response_source=proxy_injected` rather than `client_supplied`

#### Scenario: Anchor-free recovery retries claim no provenance

- **GIVEN** a recovery path dispatches without a `previous_response_id`
- **WHEN** the retry request state is prepared
- **THEN** it MUST NOT record a proxy-injected anchor
